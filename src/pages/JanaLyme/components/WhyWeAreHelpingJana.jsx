          <p className="nj-section-content">
            Jana is Zoranaâ€™s friend from music high school and music college.
            They know each other for years and have been close friends for a
            long time. As her close friend, Zorana had to find a way to help her
            and make sure she brought back her smile and music in her life. Jana
            is also part of the Stellar Sound Podcast project where she was
            writing about music articles as well as booking guests for Stellar
            Sound Podcast. Just in the middle of the season, Jana started facing
            fatigue and health issues and had to stop doing what she loved the
            most. As a dear member of the Stellar community, everyone agreed to
            take an action.
