        description3="Since Justen was not allowed animals in the house, he grew up focusing his love on the entertainment world and sports. Although he doesn’t play a musical instrument, he still appreciates the hard work and dedication that is required to master the art. Everything about music has always fascinated him, from writing lyrics to creating a unique sound; he always wondered what made a creative artist tick.

        In college, Justen began dabbling in stand-up as a way to release stress. Since stepping on stage, he was hooked! That’s where 90% of his focus would be on. Shortly after that, he started acting as well. From that industry, Justen made connections to various other artists (dancer, musicians, singers/rappers, etc) and noticed how he would drill them with questions as to:
        “How did you get into this field?”, “Who inspired you?”, “What are you most proud of?”
