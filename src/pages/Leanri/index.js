        description1='"The love of music can be compared to really good, expensive coffee.  As children, we do not need it.  Something adults need to get through the day.  Somewhere in between growing up and puberty, on a forgotten day, you drink your first sip.  Not long after, you start having daily cups and before you realize it, you can barely function without a couple of caffeinated fixes.  Music lovers will tell you the same thing.  Neither knows when or how but now music is their daily fix and trying to function without it is a pointless endeavor."'
        description3='"Music has always been a part of me.  It started the usual way, small sips of a combined obsession over the songs my parents listened to and regularly encouraged music lessons. 
                     There was a day in time when I drank in my first movie soundtrack.  It must have been some Hans Zimmer-Ennio Morricone set, but soon enough I was racking up my parent’s dial-up, downloading as many albums as possible.  When I discovered LPs and album shops, I truly was a goner.  My teens were spent learning how to arrange and write songs similar to my favorites and so, my addiction grew.  Once upon a time, I decided to make a career from this addiction and I’ve never looked back since!"'
        description4="Now, as the world has digitized, it is more likely to come across people of similar passions but entirely new approaches and, that once again has sparked anew this love.  To understand the musician’s approach and motivation, their triumphs, and struggles, is truly a privilege.  So let us come together and fill our cups, for music is the food of life."
