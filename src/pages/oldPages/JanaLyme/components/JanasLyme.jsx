            Jana has late-stage neurological Lyme disease and co-infections.
            She’s had it for 7+ years - undiagnosed and disease developed slowly
            in the beginning but in the last two years it progressed pretty
            fast. She went from being an energetic, hardworking, social person
            to housebound, because of exhaustion and fatigue that this disease
            caused. Lyme stopped her carrier, and Jana hasn’t been able to work
            or do basic everyday activities because of her symptoms.

            Jana started experiencing some of the symptoms as early as high
            school, but due to her chosen profession as violinist she ascribed
            her pains to long practicing hours and excessive physical exertion.
            Later during her university years, she developed much stronger pains
            in her back, peripheral neuropathy along with pins and needles
            feeling in her hands, loss of muscle strength which altogether made
            her unable to finish her undergraduate studies in time. She did a
            lot of physical therapy and B vitamin supplementation which helped a
            little at the time, but only to an extent. She finished her
            undergraduate and master studies later than her peers but she still
            managed to live relatively normal life. In 2020, her symptoms have
            gotten a lot worse, with multiple visits to ER but still without a
            proper diagnosis. Neurological symptoms developed rapidly, with
            tachycardia, dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, muscle twitching,
            strong debilitating muscle pains and persistent gut issues. Also,
            insomnia and memory loss caused a big problem, and finally in the
            summer of 2021 she got diagnosed with late stage neurological Lyme
            disease. By this time, Jana was bedridden, unable to do house
            chores, unable to walk or work on most days. Her Lyme has also
            reactivated Epstein - Barr virus, which has caused numerous
            consequences and thyroid problems. The longer a person has
            undiagnosed Lyme, the harder it is to treat. Lyme goes deep into
            cells, tissues, and mitochondria and can be destructive to every
            system in the body, including the heart, nervous system, and brain.
